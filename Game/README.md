# Text_Based_Adventure_Game


### Concepts used : :pencil:
   - [x] Object Oriented programming and software design principles
   - [x] File handling  
   - [x] Other basics like loop , dictionary ,list, string and its methods, random e.t.c
   - [ ] Web scraping (to be added)
   - [ ] Getting familiar with other Python concepts
  
### Insight : 
  Like normal text based adventure games, this game is divided into various breakpoints. Each breakpoint is assigned with unique id . All the informations like allowed path to proceed, view of surrounding etc are then tagged to the corresponding id.  
  
### Requirements:
   Python3.8 or above (to be added in `requirements.txt`)

### How to contribute:
  1. Get familiar with the code (I'd clean up the code soon xD).
  2. Either look up existing issues and ask it to be assigned to, or create a new issue proposing enhancements.

### Proposed Enhancements (Issues to be created soon):
   1. Break the codes into modules.
   2. Use classes following better software engineering practices.
   3. Web scraping for displaying images (optionally) along with the text description.
   4. Update database schema (use some online database than the local json file) for checkpoints of the game.
   5. Push it to pypy.
